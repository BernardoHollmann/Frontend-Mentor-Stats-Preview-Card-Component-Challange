- Frontend Mentor | Stats Preview Card Component challange
  - The challenge consisted in replicating a stats card preview page for a desktop and mobile view perspective;
  - Here it is two screenshots taken from desktop and mobile perspective;

- My process
  - Built with: HTML + CSS;
  - I have to say that this was a tricky one for me. I could use Bootsrap for this, but I tried to stick with CSS only. However, I had some dificulties in finding the best way yo use de flex display proprieties. After arranging the HTML, I would like to use the flex display to approach this challange. After some time, I noticed that I had to change de flex-direction to column in order to center the <main> tag. After that, I customized the other properties and ended up with the desktop view ready. However, when I trie to make it responsive, I noticed that something was wrong. First, I had to change all the widths to a percentage value, so the window could affect the divs <tags> better. Then, I corrected the margins and paddings. When the desktop view was ok, I tried implementing the color overlay in order to apply some kind of filter to the given image. I have to say this took me some time to figure out how to do it. After some research, I found a tutorial that helped me with that and I could implement it on this project. The result was not 100% accured, but I believe its fine. The other main problem I had to solve was regarding the responsivness of the page. I am still learning how to use media queries and changing the proprieties of the desktop to other windows sizes were something tricky. Basically, for some attributes, I just did a try and error approuch to reach an ok result. I know that there might be better solutions for this, and I am certain that there is, but that was the best I could do with the time I had.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- I learned more about the flex display approach and how to better position the elements on the screen. The used color overlay code was also a good thing to know about and how the positions absolute and relative can work together. I also learned somethings about media queries and how this can be complicated to perfect.
- I might use some other approach for this type of project in the future. Maybe a grid system would easy up the whole process.
- I know I made several mistakes in this project. Feedbacks would be much appreciated and it will help me keeping improving myself.
